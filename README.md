# -RISC-V-Register-File-and-LSU-Module-
 Designed a 32-register RISC-V register file with synchronous write and asynchronous read; verified functionality using a  testbench.â€“ Developed a Load-Store Unit (LSU) handling aligned/unaligned accesses, faults, and pipeline stalls; interfaced with  memory via tags/control signals and tested on FPGA using ILA and VIO.
